# fetches an amendment or corrigendum published under that edition's date.

# T.30 and T.4 are not modulations. They are what a fax call does over one --
# the control procedure and the page coding -- and they are here because a
# number that answers with 2100 Hz and then V.21 is a fax machine, and the only
# way to know what it will accept is to read its DIS.

# Editions wanted for a reason, with the reason.
#
#   V.42@200011  The last edition carrying Annex A, the alternative error
#                control procedure -- which is MNP, and is what everything
#                built before LAPM speaks. The 2002 revision deleted it and
#                left the heading behind: "Note that Annex A and Appendix V
#                were deleted from ITU-T Rec. V.42 in the 2002 revision." The
#                deletion says nothing about the modems still using it.
#
# The page codings that only run under T.30's error correction mode: T.6's MMR,
# JBIG as T.82 codes it and T.85 profiles it for fax, and the colour ones --
# T.42's colour space, T.43's lossless colour, T.44's mixed raster content and
# T.45's run lengths. T.85 was amended twice and T.43 once, and the amendments
# are part of what a fax machine does. The JPEG that T.4 Annex E builds on,
# T.81, is not here: it is joint with ISO and IEC, and ITU sells it rather than
# publishing it.

# and 9293 -- TCP, which obsoletes 793 and gathers fifty years of amendments to
# it into one document, so that is the one to implement against. 1122 says what
