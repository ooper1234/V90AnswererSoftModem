.SYNOPSIS
    Build the one file there is to hand to somebody.

.DESCRIPTION
    Leaves dist\binmodem.exe: a modem, the scope around it, the telnet
    terminal, the answering board and a capture to replay, in a single
    executable that needs nothing installed beside it.

    It opens on a real line, because that is what the program is for. Every
    other mode is a flag.

    The C runtime is linked in rather than depended on -- see .cargo/config.toml
    for why -- so the only things the file imports are Windows itself.
