//! Modified Huffman coding, T.4 clause 4.1.
//!
//! A fax page is a run-length code and nothing more clever than that. Each
//! line is a sequence of alternating white and black runs, starting with
//! white, and each run length is one code word out of two tables: a
//! terminating code for a length under 64, and a make-up code for the
//! multiple of 64 below it followed by a terminating code for the remainder.
//! The two colours have their own tables, because the statistics of a page of
//! text are not symmetric -- black runs are short and common, so 2 black is
//! two bits and 2 white is four.
//!
//! Every table here is Table 2, 3a and 3b of T.4, transcribed. Nothing is
//! derived: Huffman codes have no structure to derive them from, which is the
//! point of them, and a table that is nearly right produces a page that is
//! nearly a page.

/// One code word: the bits, most significant first, and how many there are.
