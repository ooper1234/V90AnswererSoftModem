//! A fax call, from either end.
//!
//! T.30 divides a call into five phases: A is getting the two machines to
//! agree they are faxes, B is finding out what they can do and settling on
//! it, C is the page, D is what to do about it, E is hanging up. This is all
//! five, from the end that dialled and from the end that answered.
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a signal is. It says what the line should be
//! doing -- a tone, the 300 bit/s control channel, or the high-speed carrier
//! at an agreed rate -- and takes back whatever bits arrived. The reason for
//! the split is that a fax call changes modulation eight or ten times before
//! a page has moved, and the rule for when it changes is procedure rather
//! than signal processing.
//!
//! The awkward part of that procedure, and the part every implementation gets
//! wrong first, is that the two ends take turns. There is no moment when both
//! are talking, and every turnaround has a settling time either side of it
//! that is longer than it looks like it should be.
