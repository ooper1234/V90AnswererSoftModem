//! Two modems calling each other through the sound card.
//!
//! The tests place calls between two modems in memory, which proves the
//! modulation and the protocols and nothing at all about audio. This places
//! the same call through a real device: out through one, back in through the
//! other, with whatever rate conversion, buffering and clock drift the machine
//! actually has.
//!
//! A single virtual cable is enough, and is in fact exactly right. What comes
//! back from a cable is what was written to it, a little later, which is
//! precisely what a two-wire line does: both directions on one pair, summed,
//! delayed by however long the path takes. The two modems hear each other
//! because they hear everything, which is the situation each of them was
//! designed for.
//!
//! What this cannot do is reach another machine. For that the output has to
//! go to a softphone's microphone and the input come from its speaker, which
//! is two cables, because one cable can only be pointed one way.
//!
//! It is a strange two-wire line all the same. A hybrid reflects in a
//! millisecond or two; a sound card puts everything back tens of milliseconds
//! later, at full strength, having been through two rate conversions on the
//! way. That is nearer a satellite hop than a local loop, and it is why V.32
//! needs the second run of echo canceller taps to work here at all: the first
//! run reaches back eight milliseconds and the reflection is nowhere near
//! that. The numbers printed at the end say whether it found it.
