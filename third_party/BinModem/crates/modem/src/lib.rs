//! A modem: the whole of one, from `ATD` to samples on the line.
//!
//! Everything below this has been built and tested on its own. A data pump
//! turns bits into a waveform and back; a handshake gets two of them to agree;
//! V.42 makes the resulting bit stream reliable; an AT interpreter turns what
//! a terminal types into requests. None of that is a modem until something
//! decides when each of them applies, which is what this does.
//!
//! The states are V.250's, and there are only four that matter. In *command*
//! state the terminal is talking to the modem and what it types is parsed. In
//! *handshaking* the line is up but the two ends have not agreed anything yet,
//! and the terminal is told nothing until they do. In *data* state everything
//! the terminal types goes down the line and everything arriving comes back
//! up, and nothing is parsed at all. *Online command* state is the odd one:
//! the connection is still there but the terminal has escaped back to talking
//! to the modem, which is how a caller hangs up without dropping carrier
//! first.
//!
//! The escape is the well-known three plusses, and the reason it needs a
//! second of quiet either side is that otherwise a file containing them would
//! drop the call carrying it.
