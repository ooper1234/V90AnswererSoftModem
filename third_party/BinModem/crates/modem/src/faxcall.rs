//! A fax call on the line: the tones, V.21, the page carriers, and T.30 above
//! them.
//!
//! The join between the two halves. [`fax::call`] knows the procedure and
//! nothing about signals; [`datapump::v21`], [`datapump::v27ter`],
//! [`datapump::v29`] and [`datapump::v17`] know the signals and nothing about
//! the procedure. This
//! puts one on top of the other and gives the result a sample at a time, which
//! is the only thing a line understands.
//!
//! The whole of the join is one question asked once a sample: what should be
//! on the line just now. A fax call answers it with a different thing eight or
//! ten times before a page has moved -- a tone, then 300 bit/s, then silence,
//! then 9600, then silence, then 300 again -- and every one of those changes
//! is a carrier going up or down at both ends.
