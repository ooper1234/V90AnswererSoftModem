//! A call over the line a sound card makes, which is a strange one.
//!
//! `modem-loop` puts two modems on one virtual cable: their outputs are summed
//! and written to it, and what comes back is read by both. That is a two-wire
//! pair, correctly, and it is the reason a single cable is enough to place a
//! real call. What is not ordinary is the shape of it. A hybrid reflects in a
//! millisecond or two and is well down on what it reflects; a sound card puts
//! everything back at full strength, tens of milliseconds later, having taken
//! it through a rate conversion each way.
//!
//! V.22bis does not care, because it hears the far end through a filter that
//! discards its own band along with the echo in it. V.32 cares entirely: both
//! directions share the band, and every threshold in the start-up is a ratio
//! to the level of the whole line, which an uncancelled echo at full strength
//! is half of.
//!
//! So this is the test for whether the echo canceller can be pointed far
//! enough away to be any use here. The delay is the one measured on real
//! hardware: 87 ms of round trip, which is a single crossing of about 44.
