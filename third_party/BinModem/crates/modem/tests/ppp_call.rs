//! A ping crossing a call, through everything.
//!
//! The sibling of `file_transfer.rs`, one layer taller. V.8 agrees a
//! modulation, the data pump carries the bits, V.42 makes them reliable,
//! V.42bis compresses them, PPP turns the octets back into frames, IPCP gives
//! the two ends addresses, and an ICMP echo goes from one to the other and
//! comes back -- with nothing knowing about anything below it.
//!
//! Everything in this is simulated except the modems, which are the same ones
//! that go on a line. There is no sound card and no telephone network: what
//! one modem writes, the other hears, one sample at a time.
//!
//! Two lines are modelled, because two are what people have. A four-wire pair
//! is the ordinary case, where each end hears only the other. One virtual
//! cable is the case somebody trying this on a single machine will hit, where
//! both ends hear everything on it including themselves, tens of milliseconds
//! later and at full strength -- and where the two instances of this program
//! meant to talk to each other actually meet.
