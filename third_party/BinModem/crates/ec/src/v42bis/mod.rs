//! ITU-T V.42bis data compression (BTLZ).
//!
//! The compression half of `CONNECT 33600/V42BIS`. Strings read from the DTE
//! are matched against a dictionary of trees and sent as fixed-length
//! codewords; the dictionary adapts as it goes and both ends build the same one
//! from the same data, which is what makes a codeword reversible.
