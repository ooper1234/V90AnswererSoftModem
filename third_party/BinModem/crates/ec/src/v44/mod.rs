//! ITU-T V.44 data compression (LZJH).
//!
//! The successor to V.42bis, and better on the things a modem actually
//! carries: the Recommendation's own summary claims "a better performance than
//! V.42 bis on many types of data", and the reason is structural rather than a
//! matter of tuning. V.42bis stores one character per dictionary entry and
//! climbs a tree a character at a time, so a long repeated string costs a
//! codeword for every character of it that was learned separately. V.44 stores
//! *string-segments* -- a node holds a run of characters and a length -- and
//! adds a second trick on top: after matching the longest string it knows, it
//! tries to carry on matching against the raw history and sends only how many
//! more characters matched (6.3.2). So a long repeat that the dictionary has
//! never seen whole still goes as one codeword and a small length.
//!
//! The dictionary is three parts rather than one (6.2.1): a root array of 256
//! entries, a node-tree of string-segments, and the history itself, which is
//! every character that has been through the encoder since the last
//! reinitialisation. Nodes point into the history rather than holding
//! characters, which is what makes a segment of any length cost the same.
//!
//! Two things it does not do that V.42bis did: there is no node recovery, and
//! no dictionary reset short of starting again. When the node-tree or the
//! history fills, the whole dictionary is reinitialised (7.11.3, 7.11.4).
