//! A complete V.42 endpoint: compression over error control over framing.
//!
//! The three layers are separately testable and separately useless. Data from
//! the terminal is compressed by V.42bis, carried in the information field of
//! a LAPM frame, wrapped in HDLC with a check sequence, and handed to the data
//! pump a bit at a time; and the reverse coming back. What the layers need
//! from each other is narrow but fiddly, and every place that wanted a working
//! link was assembling it by hand.
//!
//! The line side is a bit at a time and never runs dry. A synchronous
//! connection always carries something, and when there is nothing to say that
//! something is the flag: it keeps the far end's framing synchronised, and its
//! absence is how a modem notices the connection has gone.

/// asks twice. Its first paragraph asks unconditionally: "for increase
/// robustness under adverse channel conditions, this parameter should be set
/// to a relatively large value (e.g. 16), such that repeated attempts of a
/// procedure requiring a response shall be made over a span of several
/// seconds". Its second adds a reason that applies only after the detection
/// phase, where "the originator possesses a high degree of confidence that
/// the answerer is indeed capable of LAPM operation", and a caveat for where
/// the detection phase is omitted.
///
/// So the appendix wants sixteen here too, and this is one. What it is buying
/// with the other fifteen is the case where a response *is* coming and noise
/// spoils it, and that case is worth much less to this procedure than to the
/// one the appendix has in mind. An establishment that fails leaves no link at
/// all; this failing leaves a link without compression, and the far end's XID
/// is still read and still answered if it turns up afterwards
/// ([`Stack::receive_xid`] runs in [`Phase::Protocol`] too), so a spoiled
/// response costs a feature and not a call. Against that, every retry is paid
/// for on each call whose far end simply does not negotiate -- a far end the
/// detection phase has shown does LAPM has shown nothing about XID -- and it
/// is paid in dead time before the terminal's CONNECT ([`XID_LAST_WAIT_MS`]).
/// 9.2.2 leaves the value to each end, so this is that choice.
///
/// It decides how long a call spends negotiating, because the wait is exactly
/// the retransmissions: one XID, T401, one more, and then a round trip before
/// 8.10.3's other ending ([`XID_LAST_WAIT_MS`]). One retransmission is the
/// least any can cost, and T401 is already the line's own figure -- 1038 ms at
/// 28 800 bit/s with nothing measured, 1751 ms behind a measured 1142 ms round
/// trip -- so the budget comes to 2.0 s and 2.9 s on those two lines, the same
/// order as the fixed second this replaces. Allowing two retransmissions would
/// have put a third of a call's set-up time into asking a question twice over.
///
/// The one loss this covers is the reason the second copy is worth sending at
/// all: 7.2.1.3 has the answerer send its detection pattern at least ten times

/// T401 is not a wait for an answer, though. [`crate::lapm::t401_for_line`]

/// because what T401 governs everywhere else is a *retransmission*: deciding
/// too early that a SABME was lost sends a second one, and a far end that
/// honours it resets its sequence variables under a link already carrying
/// data. After the last retransmission there is nothing left to send. The only
/// question is when to stop waiting, and an answer, if one is coming at all,
/// arrives a round trip after the copy that asked for it -- so the margin

/// that lands after this end has gone on is still read and still answered
