//! The end with the internet, when the far end of the call is a BinModem.
//!
//! Connections arrive over the link, each one a browser's, speaking HTTP to a
//! proxy. When one says where it wants to go, a real socket is opened there
//! and from then on the two streams are each other's.
//!
//! The first octet says whether it is HTTP at all: every method name is
//! uppercase letters (RFC 9110 9). A browser set up for SOCKS opens with 5
//! instead (RFC 1928 3), and is told nothing it could use -- this end no
//! longer speaks SOCKS -- so it is said on the panel, where somebody can put
//! the setting right.
//!
//! The only blocking thing a proxy does is open the outbound connection: a
//! name has to be resolved and a handshake has to complete, either of which
//! can take seconds. That happens on a thread of its own so the link keeps
//! moving, and the answer comes back down a channel.
