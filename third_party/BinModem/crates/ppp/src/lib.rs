//! The Point-to-Point Protocol, which is what turns a modem call into a
//! network connection.
//!
//! A modem carries octets. The internet is packets, and PPP is the agreement
//! that turns one into the other: where a packet begins and ends (RFC 1662),
//! what the two ends can do (RFC 1661), who is calling (RFC 1334, RFC 1994)
//! and what address they get (RFC 1332).
//!
//! Written the same way as everything else here, against the documents rather
//! than against a memory of them, with section numbers on the constants.
//! `tools/fetch_specs.sh` downloads the RFCs beside the ITU Recommendations.
