//! The option negotiation automaton, and the packets it negotiates with
//! (RFC 1661 sections 4 and 5).
//!
//! Not LCP. RFC 1661 defines this once and every control protocol runs it:
//! LCP settles what the link can do, IPCP settles addresses, and both are the
//! same ten states and sixteen events with different options inside the
//! packets. So it is written once here and the protocols on top supply only
//! what their options mean.
//!
//! The state table below is the document's, in the document's own notation, so
//! that it can be read against page 12 line by line rather than trusted. That
//! is deliberate: a transcription error in a table this size is invisible in
//! ordinary code and produces a link that almost works.
