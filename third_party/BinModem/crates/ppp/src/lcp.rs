//! The Link Control Protocol's own options (RFC 1661 section 6, and RFC 1662
//! section 7 for the one that lives there).
//!
//! The automaton in [`super::control`] runs the negotiation; this decides what
//! to ask for and what to make of what the peer asks.
//!
//! ## Which direction an option is about
//!
//! The part that is easy to get backwards, and 6 states it once: "all
//! Configuration Options apply in a half-duplex fashion; typically, in the
//! receive direction of the link from the point of view of the Configure-
//! Request sender."
//!
//! So an option in the peer's request is a statement about what the peer will
//! receive, which makes it an instruction about how this end must send. Its
//! MRU is the largest frame this end may put on the line. Its
//! Async-Control-Character-Map is what this end must escape. Its
//! Authentication-Protocol is a demand that this end prove who it is. And the
//! options this end sends are the mirror of that, about what arrives here.
