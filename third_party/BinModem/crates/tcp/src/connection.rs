//! One connection: the TCB of RFC 9293 3.3.1 and the event processing of 3.10.
//!
//! The variables keep the document's own names, lower-cased -- `snd_una` for
//! SND.UNA and so on -- because every rule about them is written in those
//! terms and a reader with the document open should not have to translate.
//!
//! What is here and what is not:
//!
//! * The eleven states and 3.10.7's processing of an arriving segment, in the
//!   order the document does it: sequence, RST, SYN, ACK, text, FIN.
//! * Retransmission, with RFC 6298's estimator and Karn's rule about which
//!   samples may be used.
//! * The Nagle algorithm (3.7.4), delayed acknowledgements (3.8.6.3), zero
//!   window probing (3.8.6.1) and the receiver's half of silly window
//!   avoidance (3.8.6.2.2) -- all four of which matter far more on a modem
//!   than on anything this was last written for. An acknowledgement is forty
//!   octets, which at 2400 bit/s is a sixth of a second of line.
//! * Segments that arrive out of order are held rather than dropped
//!   (SHLD-31), which turns one lost segment into one retransmission instead
//!   of a stall.
//!
//! * RFC 5681: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit and fast
//!   recovery. There is one hop under this and no congestion to speak of, so
//!   the argument for leaving it out looked good until the tests were written.
//!   Fast retransmit is not really congestion control at all -- it is the
//!   difference between repairing a lost segment on the third duplicate
//!   acknowledgement and repairing it a minute later when a timer that has
//!   doubled six times finally goes off. Without it, one loss in seven turned
//!   a page into a stall.
//!
//! Not here: window scaling and timestamps (RFC 7323), selective
//! acknowledgement, and urgent data -- none of which is any use at these
//! speeds. Urgent data is read on arrival (RCV.UP is kept) and never
//! generated: RFC 6093 found the mechanism too inconsistently implemented to
//! rely on.
