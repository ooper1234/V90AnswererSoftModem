//! Carries live modem state from the signal path to a user interface.
//!
//! The producer will eventually be an audio callback, so publishing must never
//! block and must never allocate. Two channels with different characters:
//!
//! - [`Frame`] is *latest-wins*. The UI redraws at 60 Hz and only ever wants the
//!   newest scope data, so a frame the UI is too busy to collect is dropped
//!   rather than queued. Publishing uses `try_lock` and skips on contention.
//! - [`LogEntry`] is a bounded queue. Transcript lines must not be dropped just
//!   because the UI was mid-redraw, but they come from the control thread rather
//!   than the audio callback, so an ordinary lock is safe there.
//!
//! No `unsafe`: the workspace denies it. A `Mutex` whose critical section is a
//! memcpy of a few kilobytes, contended at 60 Hz by one reader, costs nothing
//! measurable next to the DSP it is reporting on.
