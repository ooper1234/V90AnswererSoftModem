//! A board over a socket, for exercising the terminal with no line under it.
//!
//! The third thing that can be on the screen, after a capture and a live line.
//! There is no modem here at all: a TCP connection to a bulletin board, the
//! telnet option negotiation on top of it, and the bytes handed straight to the
//! same [`terminal::Terminal`] a call would feed.
//!
//! It earns its place because the two halves of "the board looked wrong" are
//! otherwise impossible to tell apart. A screen full of rubbish over a modem
//! could be an escape byte the line dropped or an escape sequence the terminal
//! does not implement, and the only way to know is to remove one of them.
//! Over a socket every byte arrives, so anything still wrong is ours -- and
//! anything right here that is wrong over a call is the line's.
//!
//! It is also simply the fastest way to have a board on the screen. No cable,
//! no softphone, no trunk, no waiting for a handshake that may not converge.
//!
//! The shape is [`crate::live`]'s, deliberately: a session the window writes
//! requests into, a thread that owns the connection, and telemetry back. What
//! differs is that a socket is not a clock, so this loop paces itself off the
//! read timeout instead of off arriving samples.
