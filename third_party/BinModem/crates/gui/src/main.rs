//! Scope for the modem, over a capture or over a real line.
//!
//! Two things can be on the screen. A capture is a recording of a call
//! somebody else placed: it is replayed, watched, and cannot be typed at. A
//! live line is a modem of our own, and the terminal in the window is its DTE
//! — `AT` commands are answered, `ATD` dials, and everything the scopes show
//! is the call actually happening.
//!
//! ```text
//!   binmodem                                  a modem, line chosen in the window
//!   binmodem --in <dev> --out <dev>           and opened straight away
//!   binmodem <path.wav>                       replay a capture
//!   binmodem --capture                        replay the Bell 103 golden vector
//!   binmodem --devices                        what audio this machine has
//!   binmodem --telnet [host]                  a board over a socket, no modem
//!   binmodem --answer --in <dev> --out <dev>  a board to dial, on the same cable
//! ```
//!
//! A modem is what this is for, so a modem is what it opens with. `--live` is
//! still accepted and still means what it says; it is simply no longer the
//! thing that has to be typed to get the program's own subject on the screen.
//!
//! The last is for working on the terminal rather than on the modem. A board
//! sends the same ANSI down a socket as down a call, so the screen is the same
//! screen -- but over a socket every byte arrives, which means anything that
//! draws wrongly is the terminal's fault and not the line's. That is not a
//! distinction a capture can make.
//!
//! Neither device defaults, and `--live` on its own opens with no line rather
//! than guessing at one. The default output on a desktop machine is whatever
//! the speakers are plugged into, and a handshake played through speakers is
//! no use to anyone.
