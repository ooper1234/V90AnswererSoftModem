//! The link over the call: PPP on top of the modem, and a ping on top of that.
//!
//! What the modem hands up is octets. [`ppp`] turns those into frames and the
//! frames into an agreement about what the two ends are and what they are
//! called, after which an IP datagram can cross. This is where the two meet:
//! everything the modem gives up goes into the link, everything the link
//! produces goes back down as if it had been typed, and the window is told
//! what is happening.
//!
//! While it runs it owns the byte stream, the same way a file transfer does.
//! A PPP frame is not something a person wants on their screen and a keystroke
//! in the middle of one is a corrupt frame, so the terminal is put aside until
//! the link is dropped. That is exactly what happened on a real dial-up
//! account: a menu, `ppp` typed at it, and then the terminal was no longer a
//! terminal.
