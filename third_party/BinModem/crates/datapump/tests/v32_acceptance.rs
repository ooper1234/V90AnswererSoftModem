//! What the V.32 rebuild has to achieve, asked of whole calls.
//!
//! Every test here is two [`Modem`]s in a call, each running the whole
//! start-up and carrying data, with nothing reached into but the modem's own
//! public face: `step`, `status`, `phase`, `retrains`, `send_bits`,
//! `take_bits` and the residual error. A bare receiver fed a clean signal can
//! be made to look well on any line; a call has to get through the start-up
//! first, train on what the start-up gives it, and then hold on while the line
//! does what lines do.
//!
//! The criteria are those of `docs/design/v32-rebuild/design.md` §9.2, and the
//! definitions are §9.1's:
//!
//! - **Es/N0** is white Gaussian noise at 16 kHz of variance
//!   `(fs/2)/baud · P · 10^(−SNR/10)`, where `P` is the far signal's power as
//!   it arrives. `P` is measured rather than assumed: one clean call at each
//!   rate, and the power of what the modems put out once connected.
//! - **Working SNR** is, for each rate, 3 dB above the worse of the ideal
//!   decoder's 1e-5 point and the point where the unchanged retrain rule fires.
//! - **Held** is the call reaching the rate and coding it was offered and
//!   staying `Connected` at it for the whole run, with no retrain at either
//!   end.
//! - **BER** and **blocks**: seeded pseudo-random bits both ways from a second
//!   after connecting, cut at each receiver into 100 ms blocks, and each block
//!   found in what the far end sent by searching ±2048 bits around where the
//!   last good block said it would be. A slip then costs the blocks it lands
//!   in rather than every bit after it. Every figure is taken at each end and
//!   the worse end is the one judged.
//!
//! # The line
//!
//! Each direction goes through one chain: a true single-sideband carrier shift
//! (lock_sweep's Hilbert `Shifter`), the far end's clock by resampling, a
//! delay, the noise, the jitter buffer's slips, and last the gain the network
//! or a softphone applies -- after the noise, so that a change of gain changes
//! the level and not the signal-to-noise ratio. A hybrid adds each modem's own
//! echo and the far hybrid's reflection, as `v32_call.rs`'s line with length
//! does. The cable is `soundcard_loop.rs`'s: both modems summed onto one wire
//! at 0.45 and heard back by both 700 samples later, with the drift and slips
//! a sound card adds.
//!
//! Where §9.2 names no noise for a line there is none. Those lines are about
//! slips, gains and cables; the ones that name a noise say so.
//!
//! Slip moments and every other random choice come from fixed seeds, so every
//! number here comes out the same every time.
//!
//! # Today and after
//!
//! Tests that fail on today's receiver carry
//! `#[ignore = "V.32 rebuild: enabled by package D"]`, and package D removes
//! the marks. What they were marked on is printed by the ignored
//! `before_and_after_table`, which runs every line below, and any one line can
//! be traced -- phases, errored blocks, slips -- with `one_line_traced`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p datapump --release --test v32_acceptance before_and_after_table -- --ignored --nocapture
//! V32_LINE="cable 20 ppm" cargo test -p datapump --release --test v32_acceptance one_line_traced -- --ignored --nocapture
