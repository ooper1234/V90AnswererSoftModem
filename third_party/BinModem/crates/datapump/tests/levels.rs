//! Every transmitter leaves the modem at the same power.
//!
//! Not a property any Recommendation states, because each of them states its
//! own level in dBm at the line and says nothing about the others. It matters
//! here because one call uses several of these in turn: a fax call alternates
//! 300 bit/s frames, two single tones and a V.27 ter carrier, turning the line
//! around between each, and the machine at the far end has one gain control
//! for all of them.
//!
//! A level set nine decibels low is invisible in a loopback, where the far end
//! is exactly as loud as this end wrote it, and it costs a page on a real
//! line.
//!
//! The figure is a root mean square, not a peak. V.2 states a transmit level
//! as a power, and a shaped constellation and a constant-envelope tone with
//! the same power do not have the same peak: the peaks below run from 1.0 for
//! a tone to nearly 2 for the crowded V.32 constellations, which is what the
//! headroom in the drive setting is for.
