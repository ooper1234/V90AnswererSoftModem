//! Replay a recorded V.90 call's downstream through the analogue modem, and
//! say what each stage of the start-up made of it.
//!
//! Ignored, because it needs a capture, and captures are not in the
//! repository. The modem's own replay (`crates/modem/tests/replay.rs`) shows
//! when V.8 ended and V.90's phase 2 began; give that as a sample number:
//!
//! ```text
//! V90_CAPTURE=dist/captures/live-1789599183.wav V90_START=88704 \
//!     cargo test -p datapump --release --test v90_replay -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Only the first channel is fed in, from that sample on: the modem does what
//! it did on the day, with the far end's own signal. What it does after the
//! first thing it would have done differently -- a DIL finished sooner, say --
//! the recording cannot answer.
//!
//! What the choice at the end of the DIL comes to is shown whatever became of
//! it: the rate unshaped, the best with the spectral shaping asked for, the
//! rate chosen with the room `dil::SLACK` asks for, and what they went on. And every line the transcript would have had of phase
//! 4 -- each CP sent and MP found, E, Ed and B1d -- at the time it came.
