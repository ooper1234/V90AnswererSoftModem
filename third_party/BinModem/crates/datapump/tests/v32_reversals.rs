//! What the reversal detectors made of a real call.
//!
//! Ignored, because it needs a capture and captures are not in the repository:
//! they are large, and the ones worth having come off somebody's telephone
//! line. Point it at one with
//!
//! ```text
//! V32_CAPTURE=captures/live-1788682720.wav cargo test -p datapump \
//!     --test v32_reversals -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The question it exists to answer. On one recorded call the calling modem
//! declared a sideband reversal at 59.36 s of session time -- which was the
//! moment the far end's alternation *began*, its sidebands going from a
//! thousandth to a tenth with a settled phase, and not a reversal at all. The
//! far end's only real reversal came at 61.00 s, and was taken for the second.
//! The round-trip measurement made from that pair describes nothing.
//!
//! An earlier commit guessed at the cause and was wrong, and said so. This
//! runs the real detectors over the real recording instead of guessing again.
//!
//! What it found was that the far end's carrier was 22 to 36 Hz off frequency
//! through the stretch in question, and that the detector could not tell that
//! from a phase that had stepped. Across every recording in hand, before the
//! fix that came out of this and after it:
//!
//! ```text
//!                     carrier 1800    lower 600    upper 3000
//!   live-1788682720      51 -> 5       44 -> 1        1 -> 1
//!   live-1788682165      53 -> 5       48 -> 3        2 -> 2
//!   live-1788671074       2 -> 1       33 -> 0        0 -> 0
//!   live-1788681310      57 -> 5       35 -> 1        2 -> 1
//! ```
//!
//! The upper sideband is the column to read for whether anything real was
//! lost, because it was the one that was not chattering to begin with: three
//! of its four counts survive unchanged. The fourth went from two to one and
//! is not accounted for.
//!
//! Read again after the drift estimate stopped counting the reversal's own
//! step, which is what a phasor collapsing through a null and coming back out
//! the far side looks like sample by sample. That change was made because the
//! estimate was closing the gate on the very reversal that moved it, on a
//! carrier eighty milliseconds old and exactly on frequency -- see
//! `a_reversal_soon_after_the_tone_arrives_is_still_found` in `dsp`.
//!
//! ```text
//!                     carrier 1800    lower 600    upper 3000
//!   live-1788758849       8 -> 12       2 -> 2        2 -> 2
//!   live-1788758957       7 -> 13       0 -> 0        0 -> 0
//!   live-1788760125     260 -> 284      5 -> 9        5 -> 8
//! ```
//!
//! The sidebands hold on both telephone calls, which is what the V.32
//! start-up reads. What moved is the carrier column, and where it moved is
//! stretches that are not a V.32 carrier at all: the V.21 menu of `...849`,
//! all of `...957`, which is a V.22bis call from end to end, and the eleven
//! connected seconds of `...125`, where nothing consumes a reversal. The
//! detector is chattier than it was on signals it was not built to watch, and
//! no longer goes deaf on one it was.
