//! Channel 0 of a live recording is what came back off the line: the far

//! a `Modem` is the call happening again, with every decision this end made
//! visible and repeatable -- which a live call is not.
//!
//! What the transmitter produces is thrown away. It cannot be put back on the
//! line, so the far end in the recording is answering the call that was made
//! rather than this one; the replay is faithful up to the first point where
//! the two would differ, and that point is what is being looked for.
