//! Where a V.32 modem is allowed to stop sending one rate sequence and start
//! the next.
//!
//! 5.3.2: "In order to mark the end of transmission of any rate signal other
//! than R1 (Figure 4), the modem shall first complete the transmission of the
//! current 16-bit rate sequence, and then transmit one 16-bit sequence E."
//!
//! The far end has its framing locked to those sequences -- 5.3.1 has it
//! looking for "two consecutive identical 16-bit sequences each with bits
//! B0-3, B7, 11 and 15 conforming to Table 6" -- so an E that starts anywhere
//! else is not an E to it. It is two words that are neither, followed by
//! scrambled ones.
//!
//! Which is what this modem sent. R3 arrives whenever the line brings it and
//! never on a boundary, and the transmitter changed sequence where it was
//! asked to. On a call to a real modem the last R2 was cut short after twelve
//! of its sixteen bits and the E put there, so the far end read
//! 0101000100011111 at its own alignment -- B0-3 neither 0000 nor 1111 --
//! waited for an E that was never going to arrive where it was looking, and
//! stopped transmitting one round trip later. Every V.32 call did this, and
//! the connection that followed carried noise.
//!
//! A loopback never saw it: both ends cut the sequence short in the same place
//! and read each other perfectly.
