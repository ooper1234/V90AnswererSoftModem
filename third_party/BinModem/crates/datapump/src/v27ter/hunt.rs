//! Finding a V.27 ter burst: the turn-on sequence's reversals and its
//! conditioning pattern, where they are, and what they say about the far
//! carrier.
//!
//! The receiver this replaced found a burst by its level alone, against a
//! fixed threshold 53 dB under it, and measured the carrier once, over the
//! 48 symbols after the edge. Any hiss above the threshold was a burst, the
//! measurement was spent on it, and nothing ever measured again
//! (fax-qam.md 3.1, 3.2). So here a burst is what V.27 ter says the front of
//! one is (2.5.1): continuous 180 degree reversals, and then the equaliser
//! conditioning pattern, symbol for symbol as Table 4 prints it. Hiss is
//! neither, an unmodulated carrier in front for talker echo protection is
//! neither (5.2.1), and the hunt never stops, so whatever it took for a burst
//! that was not one, the next real one is found anyway.
//!
//! Reversals on the line are two tones, half the symbol rate either side of
//! the carrier: an alternating sequence through a Nyquist pulse is a cosine
//! at half the symbol rate. Their share of the in-band power says reversals
//! are arriving, which is what raises the carrier flag. Where the symbols are
//! centred comes from the signal's power, which swells at every centre and
//! so has a line at the symbol rate whatever the symbols are -- reversals,
//! the two-phase conditioning, or data. With the symbols centred, each
//! symbol's change from the one before says reversal or not, and the pattern
//! of changes segment 4 begins with marks exactly where it starts: it is
//! every third bit of a maximal-length sequence, itself one, so no other
//! alignment of it matches.
//!
//! The pattern is also found without the reversals in front of it. The fax
//! layer turns the line round to listen when its procedure says to, and on a
//! page that has been measured at 75 ms after the far end's turn-on began --
//! after the whole of segment 3. Segment 4's changes repeat every 127
//! symbols, 1074 being eight periods and 58 over, so any 32 of them say where
//! in that period they are, and the conditioning from there on is as known,
//! but for a half turn, as it is from the start.
//!
//! And squaring a two-phase symbol removes its phase, so the squares over
//! the reversals and the conditioning turn by twice the carrier offset,
//! which is all the core needs to be told to train on the rest (dsp::qam,
//! train.rs).
