//! V.32 and V.32bis: 2400 baud, one band both ways, 4800 to 14 400 bit/s.
//!
//! The step up from V.22bis is not the speed. V.22bis fits two directions into
//! one telephone channel by giving each half of it, which is why its receiver
//! can be handed the whole line and simply filter: everything the far end
//! sends is in one band, everything this end sends is in the other, and the
//! filter that selects the first discards the second along with the modem's
//! own echo of it.
//!
//! V.32 gives both directions the whole channel at once (2.1: one carrier, at
//! 1800 Hz, in each direction). Nothing in the received signal distinguishes
//! the far end from our own echo by frequency, so no filter can separate them
//! and one has to be subtracted instead. That is what [`dsp::EchoCanceller`]
//! is for, and it is why the two arrived together.
//!
//! Every rate of V.32 and V.32bis is implemented: 4800, 7200, 9600, 12 000
//! and 14 400, all at the same 2400 baud, differing only in how many bits ride
//! on each symbol and how many points they choose between.
//!
//! At 4800 the scrambled data is taken two bits at a time and differentially
//! encoded into a quadrant (2.4.2 with Table 1), one point to a quadrant. V.32
//! 9600 takes four at a time: the first two do the same job and the other two
//! choose between four points inside that quadrant (2.4.1.1).
//!
//! Everything faster, and 9600 itself when both ends can, is the trellis code
//! of 2.4.1.2 and V.32bis 2.3 -- see [`trellis`]. The two differentially
//! encoded bits go through a convolutional encoder that makes a redundant
//! seventh, and the whole lot chooses one of up to a hundred and twenty-eight
//! points. It buys nine decibels, and it is why 14 400 fits in the same
//! channel that 4800 does.
//!
//! Nothing else about the modem changes with the rate: the same scrambler, the
//! same start-up conducted entirely in the four states, and the same mean
//! power for the gain control to hold -- all but the fifth of a decibel that
//! V.32bis's figures put 12 000 and 14 400 above the others (`data_lift`).
