//! ITU-T V.22bis — 2400 bit/s duplex, 600 baud, 16-QAM.
//!
//! Full duplex by frequency division (V.22bis 2.1): the calling modem occupies
//! the low channel on a 1200 Hz carrier and the answering modem the high channel
//! on 2400 Hz. Because the two directions sit in different bands, no echo
//! canceller is needed — that requirement only arrives with V.32.
//!
//! Data is carried in quadbits. The first two bits are a *change* of phase
//! quadrant relative to the previous symbol (V.22bis Table 1), which makes the
//! link immune to a constant carrier phase offset that is a multiple of 90
//! degrees. The last two bits pick one of four points inside the new quadrant
//! (Figure 2).
