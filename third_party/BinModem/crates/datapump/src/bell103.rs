//! Bell 103 — 300 bps full-duplex FSK.
//!
//! Full duplex is achieved by frequency division, so the two directions occupy
//! separate bands and no echo canceller is required:
//!
//! | direction | space | mark |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | originating | 1070 Hz | 1270 Hz |
//! | answering | 2025 Hz | 2225 Hz |
//!
//! Bell 103 is the North American 300 bps standard; ITU-T V.21 is the
//! equivalent elsewhere and differs only in tone assignment (980/1180 and
//! 1650/1850), so the same receiver and transmitter serve both once given the
//! other pair of tones.
//!
//! There is almost nothing else to it, and that is why it is worth having.
//! Separate bands mean no echo canceller. A discriminator means no carrier
//! recovery. Start-stop framing that re-acquires on every character means no
//! timing loop to hold still. What is left is two tones and a moment's
//! patience, which is all it ever took to reach a bulletin board.
