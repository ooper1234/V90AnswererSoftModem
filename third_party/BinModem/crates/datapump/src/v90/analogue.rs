//! The analogue modem from phase 3 on (9.3.2, 9.4.2): V.34 going up, PCM

//!
//! A rate renegotiation (9.6) goes back to phase 4 from data mode, the
//! frames kept in step throughout: Rd and its turn to R-bar-d from the
//! digital modem, S, S-bar and CP from this end, and phase 4 from there.
//!
//! Everything upstream is V.34's, at the symbol rate, carrier and
//! pre-emphasis phase 2 settled: S, S-bar and PP as phase 3 sends them, TRN
//! at four points, Ja in J's modulation (8.3.1), CP, SCR and E as MP goes
//! (8.5.2), and then V.34's data mode as the digital modem's MP asks. What
//! comes down is read by [`super::pcm`], and what it means is worked out
//! here: Jd and J'd from the signs, the route from the DIL, R from its sign
//! pattern, and TRN2d, MP, Ed, B1d and data from whole data frames. What CP
//! asks for is the DIL's to say, and whether to ask for spectral shaping is
//! what the equaliser left of TRN1d and Jd has to say ([`super::shaping`]).
