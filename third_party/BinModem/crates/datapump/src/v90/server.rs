//! The digital modem on a sound card: what answers a V.90 call when the line
//! is a VoIP call rather than a trunk.
//!
//! V.90's digital modem is "connected to a digital network" (1), choosing the
//! codewords the network carries. A softphone's G.711 encoder is a network
//! interface of a kind: whatever arrives at it as a linear sample goes out as
//! the codeword nearest it. So the digital modem's levels are sent as samples
//! at exactly those values, at unity gain, and the encoder turns them back
//! into the codewords they were -- as nearly as the softphone's own sample
//! rate conversion allows.
//!
//! That conversion is the part nobody here controls. Between this modem and
//! the encoder there are resamplers, and they sample the signal at whatever
//! phase they happen to, and band-limit it on the way. To the analogue modem
//! at the far end, all of that is one more linear stretch of line before the
//! codec, plus the codec's quantising noise on top of it: its equaliser
//! learns the stretch on TRN1d, and its DIL measures the noise, and it picks
//! a rate that stands clear of it. With nothing resampling on the way, it
//! comes to what a trunk would give.
//!
//! The digital modem itself runs at the network's 8000 Hz. This converts
//! both ways between that and the line's rate, with windowed-sinc
//! interpolation that puts every codeword on an output sample exactly when
//! the line runs at a multiple of 8000.
