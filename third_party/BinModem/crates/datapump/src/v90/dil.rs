//! Digital impairment learning (8.4.1, 9.3.2.9): what the route does to each
//! codeword, and the constellations that follow from it.
//!
//! Between the digital modem and the codec there may be more than wire. A T1
//! carrying signalling in its bits overwrites the least significant bit of
//! every sixth octet -- robbed-bit signalling -- so in one data frame interval
//! half the codewords arrive as their neighbours. A digital pad scales every
//! level by a table. A gateway between the two companding laws moves every
//! codeword to the nearest one of the other law. None of it is announced, and
//! all of it is exact: the same codeword always arrives as the same level.
//!
//! So the analogue modem asks for every codeword, several times in every
//! interval, and writes down what arrived. The DIL descriptor says which
//! codewords and how (8.3.1); the analysis is left to the analogue modem, and
//! so is what it asks for.
