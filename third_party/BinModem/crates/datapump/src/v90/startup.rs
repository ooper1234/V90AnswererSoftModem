//! modem (9.2.1.1.8, 9.2.2.1.9).
//!
//! Both ends run V.34's start-up with V.90's phase 2 inside it. A far end
//! that is not a V.90 pair for this one leaves phase 2 with V.34's INFO1a,
//! and V.34's start-up carries on as it would have; a far end that is leaves
//! it with V.90's, and V.90 takes over from there. A V.90 start-up that
//! loses its place retrains, back through V.90's phase 2 (9.5): "Any
//! subsequent retrains shall use Phase 2 of V.90". A line that will not
//! carry PCM at all -- the DIL says so, or V.90 has failed too often -- gets
//! V.34's INFO1a in that phase 2 instead, and the call goes on as V.34.
