//! ITU-T V.90: a digital modem and an analogue modem, 56 000 down and 33 600 up.
//!
//! The asymmetry is the whole idea, and it is not about bandwidth. V.90 1
//! describes "two different modems, one a digital modem and the other an
//! analogue modem": the digital end is wired straight into the telephone
//! network's own digital path, so downstream it does not modulate anything at
//! all. It chooses G.711 codewords and the network carries them as codewords
//! (5.2: "the downstream symbol rate shall be 8000 established by timing from
//! the digital network interface"). The analogue end samples what comes out of
//! the far-end codec and decides which codeword each sample was.
//!
//! So there is no constellation downstream in the sense V.34 has one. There is
//! no I and Q and no carrier: there is a list of amplitudes the network can
//! represent exactly, and the only question per sample is which one. Upstream
//! is ordinary V.34 (1 e), which is why a V.90 call is a V.34 call in one
//! direction and something else entirely in the other.
//!
//! What limits the downstream rate is not noise in the usual sense but how
//! finely the analogue end can tell those amplitudes apart, and how many of
//! them survive the route. Two things take them away: the quiet codes are
//! eight units apart at the bottom of Uchord 1 and no receiver can separate
//! them, and a route that steals a bit for signalling halves what one of the
//! six data frame intervals can carry. That second one costs exactly one bit
//! per data frame, which is exactly one step of the rate ladder -- see [`RATE_STEP`].
