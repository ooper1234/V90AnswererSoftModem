//! A route between a V.90 digital modem and an analogue modem, simulated.
//!
//! The digital modem hands the network a level every 125 microseconds, and
//! the network carries it as a G.711 codeword -- so anything that is not a
//! codeword already is quantised to one. Towards the analogue modem the codec
//! turns codewords into a waveform through its reconstruction filter, and the
//! loop adds its noise; the other way the codec filters and samples the
//! analogue modem's waveform and quantises it. A T1 on the way can rob a bit
//! from every sixth octet, and a digital pad can scale every level.
//!
//! Two things a VoIP call adds are here too. The analogue modem's sound card
//! runs on its own clock, some tens of parts per million off the network's,
//! so every waveform is resampled between the two. And the jitter buffer in
//! the softphone now and then plays twenty milliseconds of made-up audio, or
//! drops twenty, which shifts everything after it by 160 codewords -- or by
//! however many a packet holds ([`Network::with_slips_of`]).
//!
//! A packet can also be lost and concealed where it was, with nothing moved
//! at all ([`Network::with_dropout`]): the buffer plays what it made up in
//! the place the lost packet would have filled, and everything after it stays
//! exactly where it was. Or it can be lost and not concealed at all, the hole
//! filled with digital silence ([`Network::with_silent_dropout`]), which is
//! what several softphones play when they give up concealing.
//!
//! And a path can take the top of the band away: something between the
//! network and the sound card -- a transcoder's filter, a resampler -- that
//! passes everything to 3.6 kHz and next to nothing at 4. See
//! [`Network::with_band_edge_cut`].
//!
//! And a line can be disturbed in the middle of a call: noise that comes and
//! goes ([`Network::with_bursts`]), and a floor that steps up or creeps up
//! ([`Network::with_rising_noise`]).
//!
//! Nothing here is a claim about any real network, only about what V.90 has
//! to get through.
