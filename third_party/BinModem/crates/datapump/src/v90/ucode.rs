//! V.90 3.6: "The universal code used to describe both a mu-law and an A-law
//! PCM codeword." One numbering covers both companding laws, so everything
//! above this layer talks in Ucodes and only the last step knows which law the
//! network uses.
//!
//! Table 1 prints all 128 of them with four columns each, and none of it is
//! copied here. Every value is derived from G.711 and then checked against the
//! published table -- which is the only way to use a table out of an extracted
//! PDF safely, because extraction loses columns and no test would notice.
//! There is a test that reproduces all 512 published values.
//!
//! The numbering runs the opposite way to loudness: 3.5 has "Uchord 1 contains
//! Ucodes 0 to 15", and Ucode 0 is silence while Ucode 127 is the loudest
//! code there is. The mapper then labels a constellation in descending order
//! of Ucode (5.4.4), so label 0 is the loudest point and the labels run the
//! same way as the Ucodes do not. Getting that backwards costs nothing at one
//! end and everything at two.
