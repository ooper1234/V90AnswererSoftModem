//! The digital modem from phase 3 on (9.3.1, 9.4.1): what a V.90 server
//! does, one codeword at a time.
//!
//! Here so that the analogue modem has something to talk to that is not
//! itself, and so that every sequence the Recommendation has the digital
//! modem send is sent by something written from the text. It runs at the
//! network's own rate: one sample in and one level out every 125
//! microseconds, the level always a codeword from phase 3 on.
//!
//! ```text
//! digital  (silent) ........... Sd S'd TRN1d Jd ... Jd J'd DIL ... DIL Ri ... R'i TRN2d MP MP' Ed B1d data
//! analogue S S' PP TRN Ja ...                 S ... S S' (DIL)  S S' CPt ...      CP CP' E B1 data
//! ```

//! And from data mode, a rate renegotiation (9.6), begun by either end:
