//! The analogue modem's downstream receiver: PCM codewords back out of what
//! the far codec made of them.
//!
//! There is no carrier to take off and no constellation plane. The digital
//! modem hands the network one codeword every 125 microseconds, the codec at
//! the far end of the loop turns each into a voltage, and the line smears the
//! voltages together. So the receiver is an interpolator making two samples a
//! symbol on a clock it steers, an equaliser that undoes the smear, and a
//! decision about which of the codewords the result is nearest.
//!
//! Three jobs, one after another, as V.34's receiver does them.
//!
//! Hunting Sd. Sd repeats every six symbols -- {+W, +0, +W, -W, -0, -W}
//! (8.4.4) -- and S-bar-d is the same turned over. A half-symbol sample set
//! against the one six symbols before matches all through Sd and is its
//! opposite across the change, whatever the timing and the line. And the
//! change falls on a data frame boundary: Sd starts in data frame interval 0
//! and lasts 64 frames, so where it turns over is where frames start.
//!
//! Training. TRN1d follows S-bar-d at once, and is known from its first
//! symbol: UINFO, signed by a scrambler started at zero with ones going in
//! (8.4.5). So the equaliser is solved for outright, by least squares, at
//! each alignment near where the reversal put it, and the best kept -- and it
//! comes out scaled, because the sequence is the actual codeword and not just
//! its sign. Read off a real server on a real line, this finds TRN1d, reads
//! Jd with its CRC checking, and lines the DIL the modem asked for up against
//! what arrived.
//!
//! Tracking. From there the equaliser follows by normalised least mean
//! squares on the decisions, and the clock by the error's share along the
//! output's rate of change. The line a real server was recorded on ran 73 ppm
//! off the recorder, which is a symbol every 1.7 seconds: an equaliser left to
//! absorb that walks off its own end.
