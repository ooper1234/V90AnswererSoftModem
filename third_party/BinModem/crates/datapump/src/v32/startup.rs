//! The V.32 start-up procedure (clause 5.4).
//!
//! Two modems that have never met have to agree a data rate, train an
//! equaliser at each end and an echo canceller at each end, and measure how
//! long the line takes to carry a signal there and back. None of that can use
//! a demodulator, because the demodulator is one of the things being set up,
//! so the whole exchange is conducted in fixed patterns of constellation
//! states that can be recognised as waveforms.
//!
//! The round trip is measured directly, and rather elegantly. Each modem
//! reverses the phase of what it is sending at a moment of its own choosing,
//! and starts a clock; the far end, on hearing that reversal, reverses its own
//! transmission exactly 64 symbols later; the first modem stops its clock when
//! that comes back. What is left after taking off the 64 is the time the line
//! adds, which is what the echo canceller needs to know how far back to look.
