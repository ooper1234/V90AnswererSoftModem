//! Phase 2 of the start-up (11.2): probing and ranging.
//!
//! What happens, from the end that dialled (Figure 16):
//!
//! 1. Both ends send an INFO0 and follow it with a tone, the call modem
//!    tone B at 1200 Hz and the answer modem tone A at 2400 (11.2.1.1.1,
//!    11.2.1.2.1).
//! 2. The answer modem, hearing tone B, reverses tone A. The call modem
//!    answers with a reversal of tone B exactly 40 ms after hearing that one,
//!    and the answer modem answers that with another, again 40 ms on. Each
//!    end now has a reversal of its own and the far end's answer to it, and
//!    the time between them less the 40 ms is the round trip (11.2.1.1.4,
//!    11.2.1.2.4).
//! 3. The answer modem sends L1 and L2 and the call modem measures the line
//!    with them; then the other way round, after one more pair of reversals
//!    (11.2.1.1.5 to 11.2.1.1.7, 11.2.1.2.5 to 11.2.1.2.8).
//! 4. The call modem sends INFO1c, what it found; the answer modem answers
//!    with INFO1a, what the two of them will use (11.2.1.1.8, 11.2.1.2.9).
//!
//! Each end listens on the other's frequency throughout -- tone A and INFO
//! from the answer modem are on 2400 Hz, tone B and INFO from the call modem
//! on 1200 -- and the probing signal leaves out 1200 and 2400 Hz, so that
//! each end can hear the other's tone over the echo of its own L2.
