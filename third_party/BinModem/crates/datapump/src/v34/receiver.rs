//! Hearing phases 3 and 4: the far end's QAM brought back to points.
//!
//! Three jobs, one after another.
//!
//! Hunting for S. S alternates two points, so it repeats every two symbols
//! and nothing else V.34 sends does; S-bar is S turned half a revolution. A
//! half-symbol sample set against the one two symbols before it is the same
//! throughout S and its opposite across the change to S-bar, whatever the
//! timing and the carrier's phase, so the change can be found before anything
//! has been trained.
//!
//! Training. What follows S-bar is known from its first symbol: PP, a
//! sequence chosen for exactly this, and TRN, which is scrambled ones from a
//! scrambler started at zero -- so it is as known as PP is. Checked against
//! two real modems, a Conexant softmodem's recording and a modem answering a
//! call over VoIP: each one's TRN is the zero-started scrambler's, symbol for
//! symbol, from the symbol after PP. With the sequence known, the equaliser is
//! solved for outright by least squares over a few hundred symbols, trying
//! each alignment of the sequence either side of where S-bar put it and
//! keeping the best. No adaptive equaliser converging from nothing, and no
//! blind stage.
//!
//! Tracking. From there the equaliser, the carrier's phase and the symbol
//! timing are carried along by the decisions: the equaliser by normalised
//! least mean squares, the phase by a second-order loop, and the timing by
//! keeping the equaliser's weight where training left it. A sound card
//! talking to a VoIP call runs a hundred parts per million off the far end's
//! clock, which is a third of a symbol a second, and an equaliser left to
//! absorb that would walk off its own end in seconds.
//!
//! The equaliser samples twice a symbol. That makes it indifferent to where in
//! the symbol the sampling falls, which is why a timing loop has so little to
//! do: it only has to stop the drift, not find the eye.
//!
//! Slips. A VoIP call's jitter buffer now and then plays twenty milliseconds
//! of made-up audio, or drops twenty, and everything after it arrives that
//! much later or earlier -- 69 symbols at 3429 a second, and a carrier turned
//! by whatever 20 ms of 1959 Hz comes to. The first live call to reach phase 4
//! had two in two seconds. No loop follows a jump like that, and a loop that
//! tries learns garbage: so a sudden rise in the decisions' error holds every
//! loop still, and once there is clean signal again the receiver reads the
//! last few dozen symbols afresh from the raw samples at each fraction of a
//! symbol either side, and takes up again at whichever reads back as the
//! constellation.
