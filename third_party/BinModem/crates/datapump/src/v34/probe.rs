//! L1 and L2 are the same signal at two levels: twenty-one cosines, 150 Hz
//! apart from 150 to 3750 Hz, with the tones at 900, 1200, 1800 and 2400 left
//! out and the starting phases of Table 17. It repeats 150 times a second, so
//! a receiver that looks at a whole number of repetitions sees every tone land
//! in a bin of its own, and can read the channel's gain and noise at each of
//! them. That is what decides the symbol rate, the carrier, the pre-emphasis
//! and the projected data rate that INFO1c and INFO1a carry.
//!
//! What a modem makes of the probing is its own business -- the
//! recommendation says what the results are, not how to reach them -- and so
//! is most of what is here. The signal itself is not.
