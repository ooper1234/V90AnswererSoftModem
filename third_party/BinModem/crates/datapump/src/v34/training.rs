//! Phases 3 and 4 of the start-up (11.3 and 11.4): each end trains its
//! receiver on the other's signal, the two ask each other with J for the
//! constellation to train with next, train again, and settle what data mode
//! will be in MP sequences.
//!
//! From the answer modem, with the call modem's side beneath it (Figures 19
//! and 20):
//!
//! ```text
//! answer  INFO1a, 70 ms, S S' PP TRN J J J ...            S S' TRN     MP MP' E
//! call                          S S' PP TRN J J J ... J J' TRN   MP MP' E
//! ```
//!
//! S' is S-bar. Every change is set off by hearing the other end: the call
//! modem starts its S on hearing the answer modem's J, the answer modem falls
//! silent on hearing the call modem's S-bar, starts phase 4 on hearing its J,
//! and the call modem ends its J with J' on hearing the answer modem's S-bar
//! again. So each step waits a round trip, and the timers of 11.3.2 and 11.4.2
//! all count one or two of them.
//!
//! MD, the manufacturer-defined signal a modem may train its echo canceller
//! with, is never sent from here -- INFO1 says so -- but a far end that sends
//! one is waited out.
//!
//! Data mode can go back to MP without going back to the start (11.6 and
//! 11.7): either end sends S, S-bar and, for a new rate, TRN, then both swap
//! MP sequences at four points and send E and B1 again. A rate renegotiation
//! comes out at new rates, and a cleardown -- MP asking for nothing either
//! way -- ends the call.
//!
//! ```text
//! initiating  data S S' TRN MP MP MP MP' MP' E B1 data
//! responding  data             S S' TRN MP' MP' E B1 data
//! ```
