//! V.21 channel 2 and the two fax tones, which is all a fax call needs

//!
//! T.30 runs its whole conversation over 300 bit/s frequency shift keying in
//! the high channel of V.21: 1650 Hz for a mark and 1850 Hz for a space. The
//! same two tones the V.8 negotiation uses, and the same detector, but the
//! bits are not framed into characters here. A fax sends HDLC, which is
//! synchronous, so what this hands up is a bit at a time and whoever is above
//! it finds the flags.
//!
//! The two single tones belong here too, because they are the first thing on
//! a fax call and they are how the two ends know what kind of call it is. A
//! calling fax sends 1100 Hz in bursts; an answering one sends 2100 Hz
//! steadily. Neither carries any information beyond its own presence.
