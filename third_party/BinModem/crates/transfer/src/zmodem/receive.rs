//! The receiving half of a session (8.1 to 8.3, and 9 for recovery).
//!
//! The receiver's job is mostly to say where it has got to. 8.2: "the receiver
//! compares the file position in the ZDATA header with the number of
//! characters successfully received to the file. If they do not agree, a ZRPOS
//! error response is generated to force the sender to the right position
//! within the file."
//!
//! That single rule is the whole of the error recovery. There is no window to
//! keep, no gaps to remember and no blocks to number: a subpacket that fails
//! its check is one the receiver simply did not count, and saying the count
//! puts the sender back where it belongs.
