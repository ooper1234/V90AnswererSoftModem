//! V.8: finding out what the other modem is before trying to talk to it.
//!
//! Every modem Recommendation describes a start-up, and every one of those
//! start-ups assumes both ends already agree which Recommendation is being
//! followed. Nothing in V.32 tells an answering modem that the caller wanted
//! V.32; it simply begins, and if the far end is doing something else the two
//! sit there transmitting past each other until one gives up. That failure
//! looks, from the calling end, exactly like a modem that never answered.
//!
//! V.8 is the conversation that happens first. The answering modem sends a
//! tone saying "I can do this"; the calling modem answers with a list of what
//! it has; the answering modem replies with the ones they share; and both then
//! jump straight into the start-up of whichever they picked. Clause 1: "a
//! means to determine automatically, prior to initiation of modem handshake,
//! the best available operational mode between two DCEs".
//!
//! What is here is the messages -- the octets of CM, JM, CI and CJ, and the
//! rule that turns two menus into one choice. It owns no line and no timers:
//! the messages ride on V.21 at 300 bit/s, framed as ordinary start-stop
//! octets, and that is somebody else's problem. Which means the whole of the
//! negotiation can be tested without a modem anywhere near it.
//!
//! Bit order throughout is the Recommendation's: the tables read
//! `Start b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 Stop`, so `b0` is the first data bit after
//! the start bit, which is the least significant bit of the octet an
//! asynchronous framer hands over.
