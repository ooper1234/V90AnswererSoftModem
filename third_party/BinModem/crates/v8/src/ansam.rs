//! Telling V.8's answering tone from V.25's.
//!
//! 7.2: "modified answer tone ANSam consists of a sinewave signal at
//! 2100 +/- 1 Hz with phase reversals at an interval of 450 +/- 25 ms,
//! amplitude-modulated by a sinewave at 15 +/- 0.1 Hz. The modulated envelope
//! shall range in amplitude between (0.8 +/- 0.01) and (1.2 +/- 0.01) times its
//! average amplitude."
//!
//! This matters because of the sentence in 7.2 that governs everything after
//! it: "a call DCE shall not transmit a signal CM unless ANSam has been
//! detected." A calling modem that cannot tell the two tones apart either
//! never negotiates, or talks V.8 at a modem that has never heard of it.
//!
//! The reversals are not the thing to look for, though they are the obvious
//! candidate. 7.2 again: "when network echo canceller disabling is not
//! required, phase reversals shall not be imparted to the ANSam signal" -- they
//! are there to knock out network echo cancellers, exactly as in V.25, and an
//! ANSam without them is a legal ANSam. What is always present is the
//! modulation, and that is what this looks for.
//!
//! Note 1 to 7.2 is worth reading before choosing time constants: "detector
//! design needs to allow for transient variations in the received answer-tone
//! amplitude and phase that may be generated occasionally by network
//! equipment". A reversal is such a transient, and it is imparted by the far
//! end deliberately twice a second.
