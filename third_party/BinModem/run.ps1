.SYNOPSIS
    Build and launch the BinModem scope.

.DESCRIPTION
    With no arguments, offers a menu of the golden capture vectors and launches
    the scope on the chosen one. Only the Bell 103 capture decodes to text so
    far; the rest still show their handshakes on the waterfall, which is worth
    watching in its own right.

.PARAMETER Vector
    Path to a WAV to load, or the short name of one in tests\vectors
    (for example "v34-33600"). Skips the menu.

.PARAMETER Dev
    Build the debug profile instead of release. Slower, but builds faster.

.PARAMETER List
    Print the available vectors and exit.

.PARAMETER Live
    Put a real modem on a real line instead of replaying a capture. Offers a
    menu of the machine's audio devices, and offers to start a second modem on
    the same line so that there is something to dial.

.PARAMETER Telnet
    Open a terminal onto a board over a socket, with no modem and no line
    anywhere in it. For working on the terminal rather than on the modem: a
    board sends the same ANSI either way, but over a socket every byte arrives,
    so anything that draws wrongly is the terminal's fault and not the line's.
    Takes a host, or nothing to choose one in the window.

.PARAMETER Carrier
    Modulation for a live call: B103, V22B or V32. Both ends have to agree, so
    this sets it for the board as well.
